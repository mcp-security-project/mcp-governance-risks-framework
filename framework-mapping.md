# Framework Mapping Appendix

**Purpose:** Map MCP Governance & Risk Model controls to established security and AI governance frameworks. Use this appendix for compliance audits, gap assessments, and alignment with existing organizational programs.

**Related guide:** This mapping references the [MCP Governance & Risk Framework v1.0](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md), which contains **six chapters** (Executive Summary through Risk Scoring) plus a **closing appendix** (control catalog, evidence pack, hardening, detection/IR, and checklists). There are no separate Chapters 7–15 in v1.0 — approval workflow, monitoring, incident response, and metrics content lives in Chapters 1, 3, 4, 6, and the appendix sections linked below.

## OWASP LLM Top 10

MCP governance intersects with LLM security risks because agents use LLMs to decide which tools to invoke. Rows follow the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 edition.

## Using This Mapping

### For Compliance Audits

1. Identify the framework your auditor is assessing against
2. Locate the relevant mapping table in this appendix
3. Reference the guide chapter or appendix section that implements each control
4. Provide evidence: risk register entries, approval decisions, evidence packs, audit logs

### For Gap Assessments

1. Start with the OWASP MCP Top 10 mapping (most MCP-specific)
2. Cross-reference with NIST AI RMF Govern and Manage functions
3. Identify controls marked as "Recommended" or "Optional" in the [Formal Control Catalog](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#formal-control-catalog) that your organization has not implemented
4. Prioritize gaps by risk tier of affected MCP servers

### For Program Integration

If your organization already has an AI governance program:

- **Do not create a parallel process.** Map MCP governance lifecycle stages to existing AI system approval workflows
- **Extend existing templates** with MCP-specific fields from [Chapter 4 — Required fields](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#required-fields)
- **Add MCP metrics** to existing AI governance dashboards using [Chapter 1 — Step 5](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#step-5-define-monthly-metrics) KPIs
